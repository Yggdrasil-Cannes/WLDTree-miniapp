## 🔧 ARCHITECTURE FIXES

### ✅ Separated Onboarding from Tree Page
- **Issue**: Tree page had splash screen and wallet connection
- **Fix**: Removed onboarding elements, kept tree page pure
- **Result**: Clean separation of concerns

### ✅ Updated Navigation System
- **Issue**: Old TabBar was routing incorrectly
- **Fix**: Created new TabNavigation component
- **Result**: Proper tab switching and component integration

### ✅ Fixed Component Integration
- **Issue**: Broken MainScene component
- **Fix**: Replaced with new component system
- **Result**: All visualizations working together

## 🎨 VISUAL REQUIREMENTS MET

### ✅ Blockchain Color Palette Applied
- **Genesis Gold**: `#FFD700` for root ancestors
- **First Gen Green**: `#00ff88` for first generation
- **Second Gen Blue**: `#4ecdc4` for second generation
- **DNA Colors**: Pink A, Cyan T, Green G, Orange C
- **Connection Lines**: `#00ff88` gradient glow

### ✅ 3D Effects Implementation
- **Perspective**: 1000px+ for all 3D containers
- **Transform Style**: `preserve-3d` for proper 3D rendering
- **Hover Effects**: 1.1x scale with glow animations
- **Depth Positioning**: Proper z-axis transforms
- **Rotation**: Smooth DNA helix rotation

### ✅ Interactive Features
- **Hover States**: Visual feedback on all interactive elements
